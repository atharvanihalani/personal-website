Hi! I'm Atharva. 

This website is a living process document. I'd love to show you what I'm working on, and my process of creation.

Creating a website has been tough. It's the same problem as writing on a blank page. There are so many directions to choose from; so many narratives to pick. I'm not sure how to do that. This is a starting point – this page, the layout, everything about this website will probably change, and then change again. It's going to be a fun time.

I'm glad to have you here.
