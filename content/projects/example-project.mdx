Write about your project here — what it does, why you built it, how it works.

This file lives at `content/projects/example-project.mdx`. Delete it and create your own.

You can embed images, videos, and custom components:

<Figure src="/images/screenshot.png" caption="a screenshot of the project" />

<Video src="/videos/demo.mp4" caption="quick demo" />
