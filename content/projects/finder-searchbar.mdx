What problem does this solve?  
Finder search kinda sucks. [ftnote – actually it has gotten somewhat better with the latest update]. I always have a bunch of irrelevant modules / sysfiles / logs showing up, and it's hard to find what I'm looking for.

Time spent?     
3 hrs

Description  
This is a raycast extension for minimal file search. It's quite opinionated, but it works for me. Features:
- Keyboard shortcut to launch
- 'Enter' reveals the file in finder, 'Cmd + Enter' opens it directly

Design decisions
I built on top of Raycast, because I didn't want to design the UI myself.
I like *fiewing* files in finder, just not *searching* for them there!
- Many niceties – preview, view metadata, etc
- => Enter defaults to *view in finder*
Better search
- Search is limited to Documents & Downloads (which is where 95% of my relevant files are)
- Claude generated a *bunch* of file-pattern exclusions, to get rid of logs / build files / internal scrapes / etc
- Simple sorting by subword match


[22nd Feb] Do I use this?
Yeah! The latest version of Finder *has* improved and is more expressive. But for quick, simple file search, I generally default to this.
