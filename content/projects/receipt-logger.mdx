## What problem does this solve?

Reduces friction for logging expenses to my budget.

## Time spent?

~an hour

## Description

I clauded up a discord bot, that I dm-ed my spending logs. It automatically added that to a google sheet.
I use discord through beeper, so this works quite well!

## [22nd Feb] Do I use this?

Nope, not really. The spreadsheet was quite barebones & wasn't well organized for a budget.
- Putting in 30 mins to prettify everything would go a long way.
- Also, auto-logging receipts from my email would help a tonne
