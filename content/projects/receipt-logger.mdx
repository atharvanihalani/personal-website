What problem does this solve?  
Reduces friction for logging expenses to my budget.

Time spent?     
~an hour

Description  
I clauded up a discord bot, that I dm-ed my spending logs. It automatically added that to a google sheet.  
I use discord through beeper, so this works quite well!

[22nd Feb] Do I use this?
Nope, not really. The spreadsheet was quite barebones & wasn't well organized for a budget. 
- Putting in 30 mins to prettify everything would go a long way.
- Also, auto-logging receipts from my email would help a tonne
