What problem does this solve?  
There are some incredible AI tools that have come out recently. This keeps me up-to-date with what's new. Seems good to have an eye on the ball.

Time spent?     
~two hours

Description  
- I scrape info from specific subreddits, substacks, Hackernews, etc.  
- Run it through basic link filtering + dedups
- Create a one-line summary for each link, & forward them to a discord dm
- Run this daily with a cron job

[22nd Feb] Do I use this?
Nope. This hasn't been very useful. Why?
- Great tools are rare. Might be better to wait for them to percolate through my information ecosystem (eg. through twitter circles, friends of friends, etc).
    - Arguably optimizing my info ecosystem would be more effective here. You are what you consume
- Also, many of these tools are solving different problems from the ones I have. The bottleneck is more 'me not knowing what I'm looking for'. And if I know that, I can go and targeted-ly search for it myself.
