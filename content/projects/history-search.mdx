What problem does this solve?  
You can't filter by date in Chrome's history. That's absurd. If I wanted to find something from 6 months ago, that's impossible unless I know exactly what I'm looking for.

Time spent?     
~45 mins

Description  
This is a web page that's always running locally. For me, it's strictly better than Chrome's / Arc's history. 
Turns out Chromium browsers store history locally in a single .db file. You can just read from this, and create custom search tools on top.
- Can filter by start / end date range
- If you have multiple profiles, you can filter by them
- Lets you manually refresh the history cache (though you could automate this with a cron job too)
- Added a simple dedup pass to filter out identical, subsequent URLs

[22nd Feb] Do I use this?
Yeah!! This has superseded my default Arc history search. Search-by-date has actually, practically helped me on a few occasions. It slots in very easily.

Learnings / Reflections
Good search gives you many different ways to query your information structure.
